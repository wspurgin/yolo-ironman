2. This question is answered by running jarvis.py The results are not suited to
be shown in this format. It is recommended to make the console window maximized
when running the program in order to make the results more legible

5. The process that we do this can be found in the parser.py file, specifically
in the retrieveText function on line 36. On line 44, the .get_text() function
returns only the text within tags, like so:
 
 <p id="Hello">This is text</p>  ->  "This is text" 

 That function is specifically for BeautifulSoup objects, which we are using to
 grab URLs and parse the pages. We then hash the returned text after all the
 stop words have been removed and the remaining words stemmed to create the unique
 document ID. Because of the nature of hashes, we are assuming that if two hashes
 are the same, then they are considered to be 100% duplicate pages, and we ignore
 them.
