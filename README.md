Dependencies
------------

### Python 2.7

Most operating systems come with Python installed out of the box. While most use
Python 2.7.x, your OS may not. If it does not have any Python, it is recommended
to [install Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

### `requests` module

This project uses [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/),
the "HTTP for Humans" python module. It is, like the claim suggests, a much
nicer HTTP implementation to use than the default python module. It can be
installed using `pip`.

```
pip install requests
```

You can also download the tarball, zipball, or use git following [these
instructions](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/).
