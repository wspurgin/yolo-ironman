Will:
I wrote the ironman.py, robot.py, crawl.py, and made major adjustments to
jarvis.py in version 2.0 to repurpose it for URL frontier management. Likewise
I wrote the UI and executable yolo.

Joe:
I made major adjustments to the indexer.py and parser.py to support the new
Document object in document.py, which I also wrote. I also wrote the Pepper 
object and .py file to handle the queries given by the user through the UI.
