Will:
I wrote the ironman.py, robot.py, crawl.py, and made major adjustments to
jarvis.py in version 2.0 to repurpose it for URL frontier management. Likewise
I wrote the UI and executable yolo.

Joe:
I wrote indexer.py, parser.py, jarvis.py, and made modifications to porter.py so
that it will better suit our needs.
